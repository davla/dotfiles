# This variables file contains i3-specific varables.

variables:

  # These variables define the size of floating windows. The reason why they
  # are not in the i3 config file is HiDPI screens. Indeed, the size needs to
  # be doubled up in a dedicated Xresources file for those monitors.
  i3_floating_width: 900
  i3_floating_height: 550
  i3_editor_width: 1000
  i3_editor_height: 850

  # These variables define i3blocks signals. They are here since the signals
  # are consumed by i3blocks in its config file, but are produced somewhere
  # else, generally in other dotfiles.
  apt_signal: 10
  caps_signal: 20
  network_signal: 30

  # These variables define the colors used in i3-blocks
  i3_blocks_ok_color: '#00FF00'
  i3_blocks_inactive_color: '#666666'
