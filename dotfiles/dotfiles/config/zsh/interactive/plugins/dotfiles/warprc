    This is the wd zsh plugin configuration file.

    This is just a "router" to the actual file, which is host-specific. Other
    implementation that didn't include this additional file were considered,
    but all of them had worse drawbacks:
    - Dotdrop's dynamic `src` in dotfile entries could be used, so that `src`
      includes the hostname, but `dst` is constant. However, this would require
      that this file had a standalone dotfile entry, while it is far more
      convenient that it is part of the zsh directory dotfile.
    - The wd plugin could be configured to use the host-specific file directly,
      by means of a jinja variable containing the hostname in `init.zsh`.
      However, this makes it impossible to ignore the other hosts' files via an
      `instignore` in the zsh directory dotfile, as the filenames all match the
      same glob.
    Therefore, this implementation has been chosen, which both keeps this file
    as part of a directory dotfile and allows other hosts' files to be ignored
    when installing the zsh directory dotfile.
