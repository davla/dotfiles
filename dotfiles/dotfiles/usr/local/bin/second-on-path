#!/usr/bin/env sh

# This script runs the second match on PATH of a given command, instead of the
# first like a conventional shell. This allows to shim an executable by just
# placing it in a directory that appears at the beginning of PATH, like
# /usr/local/bin.
#
# Arguments:
#   - $1: the command to lookup on PATH
#   - $2+: any argument the command in $1 accepts
