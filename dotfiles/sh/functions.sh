# This is a convenience function for exa long form. Other than calling exa with
# a bunch of nice options, it paginates the output if it doesn't fit in one
# screen, but without using a separate buffer.
#
# NOTE: It is not an alias since the parameter is not in last position.
#
# Arguments:
#   - $1: The directory or file to be listed. Optional, defaults to the current
#         working directory.
#   - $2+: exa options to be added to the present ones. Optional. It includes
#          the first argument if it's not an existing path.

# This is a convenience function for exa tree form. Other than calling exa with
# a bunch of nice options, it paginates the output if it doesn't fit in one
# screen, but without using a separate buffer.
#
# NOTE: It is not an alias since the parameter is not in last position.
#
# Arguments:
#   - $1: The directory or file to be listed. Optional, defaults to the current
#         working directory.
#   - $2: Tree levels to be displayed. Optional, defaults to 2. If the first
#         argument is omitted, this one can replace it.
#   - $3+: exa options to be added to the present ones. Optional. It includes
#          the first two arguments when they are omitted.
