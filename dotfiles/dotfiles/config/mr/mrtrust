{#@@
    This dotfile simply includes the right content from other dotfiles based
    on system variables like host or user.

    The mutually exclusive inclusion of host-specific and user-specific mrtrust
    files is by design. In fact, this allows the host-specific mrtrust file
    to completely override the user-specific one, while it is still possible
    for the former to manually include the latter if necessary. Conversely,
    this would not be possible if both the files were included top-level here.
