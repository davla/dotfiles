# This file integrates sway and systemd. This includes:
# - importing some sway-related variables into the systemd user environment,
#   including the dbus-activated systemd services
# - starting a custom-made sway-session.target
#
# This file is meant for replacing the the systemd integration shipped with the
# linux distribution's sway package, rather than for building on top of it, for
# these reasons:
# - The i3 package doesn't come with a systemd integration, so there's nothing
#   to build on top of
# - The sway package systemd integration doesn't allow to chain `systemctl
#   import-environment` and `systemctl start sway-session.target` (as
#   recommended by the sway wiki at https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/Systemd-integration)
#   without modifying the package files
# - The sway package systemd integration doesn't import the I3SOCK variable
# Hence, the most pragmatic solution is to replace the systemd integration
# altogether.
