    This is a custom-made file. It is not actually saved anywhere on the file
    system, but rather processed by a program to set some configuration via
    gsettings. In fact, gsettings stores its settings in binary format, so
    there's no configuration file to just copy somewhere on the file system.

    The top-level key are gsettings schemas, while the nested values are
    key-value pairs of settings values in such schema.
