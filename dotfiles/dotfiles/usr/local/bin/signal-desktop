# For some reasons, the Signal desktop application doesn't display any window
# in my current sway setup when executed alone. It takes another Signal desktop
# process, which exits immediately, to display the windows for the first. This
# is very likely due to Signal "single instance application" feature.
#
# Hence, we simply spawn Signal desktop in the background first, waiting until
# a specific log line is output that signals (hehe) that this instance is
# ready, and then we execute the second process.
