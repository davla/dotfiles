# dotfiles
My dotfiles repository. Really, just configuration files

## Roadmap
- $HOME dotfiles linked to DOTDIR
- interactive vs non-interactive in bashrc and zshrc
- LS_COLORS
- GNOME keyring without LightDM
  (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Automatic_login)
- Better place for system envvars (Android, asdf)
- Anacron on battery
