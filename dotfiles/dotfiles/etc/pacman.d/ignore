    Since the list of ignored packages changes wildly over time, it has not
    been committed to the repository. Instead, it should be edited in the
    installed dotfile.

    The reason for this dotfiles's existence is to provide some scaffolding
    for ignoring packages in pacman (e.g. having a place for the ignored
    packages list and including it in the main pacman.conf file).
