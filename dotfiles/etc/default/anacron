#
# NOTE:
#       For ANACRON_RUN_ON_BATTERY_POWER, settings here only works
#       when you are not using systemd.
#       Please read /usr/share/doc/anacron/README.Debian
#       to see how to adjust program behaviour on AC power.
#
# If set to "yes", start anacron even when on battery power.  By
# default, the /etc/init.d/anacron script tries to avoid running
# anacron unless on AC power, so as to avoid running down the battery.
# (Things like the locate updatedb cause a lot of I/O.)

ANACRON_RUN_ON_BATTERY_POWER=yes

# ANACRON_ARGS
#
# Arguments/options to pass to anacron.
# By default, "-s" is used to ensure serialised job arrangements.
# If you want tasks to execute in parallel when the jobs are due to
# start, do not pass "-s" here.
