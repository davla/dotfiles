# This script is meant to be used for applications kept in the i3 scratchpad.
# It acts differently according to the application and its windows state:
# - If the application is not running, it starts it
# - If the application is running, it toggles its windows back and forth from
#   the scratchpad
# - If the application is not running, but its windows are not in the
#   scratchpad, it moves them to the scratchpad
#
# Arguments:
# - $1: The command used to start the application and to check if it's running
# - $2: The i3 command criterion used to select the application windows

# The first line pops the application windows from the scratchpad. If it exits
# with an error it means that the application windows are not in the
# scratchpad, since we checked before that the application is actually running.
# Only in such case the second line is executed, which moves the application
# windows into the scratchpad.
