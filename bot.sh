#!/usr/bin/env sh

# This script interactively sets up the whole system, one step at a time, by
# displaying various prompts at the user. This is done via a friendly and
# supportive bot assistnt, that is not ashamed of showing its feelings and
# facial expressions [^_^]. Each step outputs in a separate terminal buffer, as
# well as a log file. Steps can be skipped and repeated.
#
# Arguments:
#   - $1: The terminal width, used when wrapping the bot's messages. Defaults
#         to $COLUMNS and then to 80.
